            <p>A big warm welcome from Birmingham! The geographical heart of England, Birmingham began life as a 
                sixth- century Anglo-Saxon village. Today, much of this city of over a million dates back to post-WWII 
                redevelopment in the 1950s and 60s. We are also known as England's second city after London, and the city of
                a thousand trades. Birmingham in the West Midlands, was once a manufacturing powerhouse and continues to 
                displays the results of its amazing growth during the Industrial Revolution. Cutting edge museums and 
                galleries, innovative theatres and excellent shopping have contributed to Birmingham's appeal as a weekend 
                break destination. Don't miss the Balti Triangle, home to the Pakistani food in the UK, the hopping bars and 
                cafes of Gas Street Basin, or the National Sea Life Centre. So, whether you are a visitor or a local, there is 
                so much for you to do and explore. </p>

                   and took the time to show my children the bits and bobs in the different areas in Birmingham. 
                   Our other tour guide Tony was also amazing. We all loved it. Thank you so much would highly
